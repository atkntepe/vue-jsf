# vue-jsf

A lightweight Vue 3 library for generating dynamic forms from JSON Schemas. Built with Tailwind CSS for styling, Vuelidate for validation, and extensibility in mind via Composition API and slots.

## Purpose
This project aims to fill a gap in the Vue ecosystem: easy, schema-driven forms for API-heavy apps like admin panels or surveys. It parses JSON Schema Draft 7+ to auto-render fields with built-in validation, custom types, and Tailwind themes out of the box.

## Status
Currently in early developmentâ€”core features are coming soon! Check back for updates, or contribute via issues/PRs.
